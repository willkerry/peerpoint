## External services

- **Transactional mail:** Iâ€™m using a commercial mail delivery service for transactional email. This project accesses it with [Nodemailer](https://nodemailer.com), so any SMTP server could be swapped in.
- A dedicated instance of **Judge0** is running in the cloud separately.
