## To run locally

1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies with `npm i`
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory (see `.env.template` for
   reference). For full functionality, you will need to set up a local database
   and connect to an mock SMTP server.
4. Run `npx prisma generate` to generate the Prisma client
5. Run `npx prisma migrate dev` to create the database
6. Launch the development server with `npm run dev`
7. The application should be available at `localhost:3000`

To generate a production build, run `npm run build`. To start the production
server, run `npm start`.

## External services

- **Transactional mail:** Iâ€™m using a commercial mail delivery service for transactional email. This project accesses it with [Nodemailer](https://nodemailer.com), so any SMTP server could be swapped in.
- A dedicated instance of **Judge0** is running in the cloud separately.
